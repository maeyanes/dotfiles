# dotfiles
* On a fresh macOS:
  * Setup with a one-liner:

    ```bash
    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maeyanes/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
    ```

    

  * Open a Fish shell an execute `install_oh_my_fish` function.

  * Enter license information of purchased applications.

    

* Execute `bootstrap` function freely which in turn executes the bootstrapping script.
